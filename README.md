# Open Hardware Definitions

In essence, this repository is an attempt to:
1. Collect machine (and human) readable definitions for the memory maps in microcontrollers
2. Make that data easy to use with common reverse-engineering tools such as [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)
3. Make that data easy to gather (parse from data sheets, other file formats, ...)
