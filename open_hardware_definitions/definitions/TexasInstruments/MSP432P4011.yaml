        (~0 left bit-shifted by MASK)) == COMP. However, the actual comparison is
        slightly more complex to enable matching an address wherever it appears on
        a bus. So, if COMP is 3, this matches a word access of 0, because 3 would
        be within the word.

        overrides this bit. Vector catching is semi-synchronous. When a matching event
        is seen, a Halt is requested. Because the processor can only halt on an instruction
        boundary, it must wait until the next instruction boundary. As a result, it
        stops on the first instruction of the exception handler. However, two special
        cases exist when a vector catch has triggered: 1. If a fault is taken during
        vectoring, vector read or stack push error, the halt occurs on the corresponding
        fault handler, for the vector error or stack push. 2. If a late arriving interrupt
        comes in during vectoring, it is not taken. That is, an implementation that
        supports the late arrival optimization must suppress it in this case.'
