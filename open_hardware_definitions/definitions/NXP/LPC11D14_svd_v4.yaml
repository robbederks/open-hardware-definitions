      description: Loopback Mode Select. The modem loopback mode provides a mechanism
        to perform diagnostic loopback testing. Serial data from the transmitter is
        connected internally to serial input of the receiver. Input pin, RXD, has
        no effect on loopback and output pin, TXD is held in marking state. The four
        modem inputs (CTS, DSR, RI and  DCD) are disconnected externally. Externally,
        the modem outputs (RTS, DTR) are set inactive. Internally, the four modem
        outputs are connected to the four modem inputs. As a result of these connections,
        the upper four bits of the MSR will be driven by the lower four bits of the
        MCR rather than the four modem inputs in normal mode. This permits modem status
        interrupts to be generated in loopback mode by writing the lower four bits
        of MCR.

      description: Selects which of the AD7:0 pins is (are) to be sampled and converted.
        Bit 0 selects Pin AD0, bit 1 selects pin AD1,..., and bit 7 selects pin AD7.  In
        software-controlled mode (BURST = 0), only one channel can be selected, i.e.
        only one of these bits should be 1.  In hardware scan mode (BURST = 1), any
        numbers of channels can be selected, i.e any or all bits can be set to 1.
        If all bits are set to 0, channel 0 is selected automatically (SEL = 0x01).

        MHz or slightly less, but in certain cases (such as a high-impedance analog
