        DMA controller is the flow controller, in which case the value must be set
        before the channel is enabled. Transfer size is updated as data transfers
        are completed. A read from this field indicates the number of transfers completed
        on the destination bus. Reading the register when the channel is active does
        not give useful information because by the time that the software has processed
        the value read, the channel might have progressed. It is intended to be used
        only when a channel is enabled and then disabled. The transfer size value
        is not used if a peripheral is the flow controller.

        signal for the previous frame has been negated for active mode, or the extra

        the LCD panel clock frequency LCD_DCLK from the input clock, LCD_DCLK = LCDCLK/(PCD+2).
        For monochrome STN displays with a 4 or 8-bit interface, the panel clock is
        a factor of four and eight down from the actual individual pixel clock rate.
        For color STN displays, 22/3 pixels are output per LCD_DCLK cycle, so the

        divider can be bypassed by setting the BCD bit in this register. Note: data

      description: Loopback Mode Select.  The modem loopback mode provides a mechanism

        no effect on loopback and output pin, TXD1 is held in marking state. The 4
        modem inputs (CTS, DSR, RI and DCD) are disconnected externally. Externally,
        the modem outputs (RTS, DTR) are set inactive. Internally, the 4 modem outputs
        are connected to the 4 modem inputs. As a result of these connections, the
        upper 4 bits of the MSR will be driven by the lower 4 bits of the MCR rather
        than the 4 modem inputs in normal mode. This permits modem status interrupts
        to be generated in loopback mode by writing the lower 4 bits of MCR.

        If this bit cleared to 0 while a character is being sent, the transmission
        of that character is completed, but no further characters are sent until this
        bit is set again. In other words, a 0 in this bit blocks the transfer of characters
        from the THR or TX FIFO into the transmit shift register. Software can clear
        this bit when it detects that the a hardware-handshaking TX-permit signal
        (CTS) has gone false, or with software handshaking, when it receives an XOFF
        character (DC3). Software can set this bit again when it detects that the
        TX-permit signal has gone true, or when it receives an XON (DC1) character.

        If this bit is cleared to 0 while a character is being sent, the transmission
        of that character is completed, but no further characters are sent until this
        bit is set again. In other words, a 0 in this bit blocks the transfer of characters
        from the THR or TX FIFO into the transmit shift register. Software implementing
        software-handshaking can clear this bit when it receives an XOFF character
        (DC3). Software can set this bit again when it receives an XON (DC1) character.
