      description: Loopback Mode Select. The modem loopback mode provides a mechanism
        to perform diagnostic loopback testing. Serial data from the transmitter is
        connected internally to serial input of the receiver. Input pin, RXD, has
        no effect on loopback and output pin, TXD is held in marking state. The four
        modem inputs (CTS, DSR, RI and  DCD) are disconnected externally. Externally,
        the modem outputs (RTS, DTR) are set inactive. Internally, the four modem
        outputs are connected to the four modem inputs. As a result of these connections,
        the upper four bits of the MSR will be driven by the lower four bits of the
        MCR rather than the four modem inputs in normal mode. This permits modem status
        interrupts to be generated in loopback mode by writing the lower four bits
        of MCR.

        THR is output on the TXD pin as soon as any preceding data has been sent.
        If this bit cleared to 0 while a character is being sent, the transmission
        of that character is completed, but no further characters are sent until this
        bit is set again. In other words, a 0 in this bit blocks the transfer of characters
        from the THR or TX FIFO into the transmit shift register. Software can clear
        this bit when it detects that the a hardware-handshaking TX-permit signal
        (CTS) has gone false, or with software handshaking, when it receives an XOFF
        character (DC3). Software can set this bit again when it detects that the
        TX-permit signal has gone true, or when it receives an XON (DC1) character.

      description: Selects interrupt on pin x to be cleared (x = 0 to 11). Clears
        the interrupt edge detection logic. This register is write-only. The synchronizer
        between the GPIO and the NVIC blocks causes a delay of 2 clocks. It is recommended
        to add two NOPs after the clear of the interrupt edge detection logic before
        the exit of the interrupt service routine. 0 = No effect. 1 = Clears edge
        detection logic for pin PIOn_x.
