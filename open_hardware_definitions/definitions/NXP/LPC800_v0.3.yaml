      description: Received Noise interrupt flag. This bit is valid when there is
        a character to be read in the RXDATA register and reflects the status of that
        character. Three samples of received data are taken in order to determine
        the value of each received data bit, except in synchronous mode. This acts
        as a noise filter if one sample disagrees. The Noise bit is set when a received
        data bit contains one disagreeing sample. This could indicate line noise,
        a baud rate or character format mismatch, or loss of synchronization during
        data reception. RXNOISEINT is not updated during a received break.

      description: Received Noise interrupt flag. This bit is valid when there is
        a character to be read in the RXDATA register and reflects the status of that
        character. Three samples of received data are taken in order to determine
        the value of each received data bit, except in synchronous mode. This acts
        as a noise filter if one sample disagrees. The Noise bit is set when a received
        data bit contains one disagreeing sample. This could indicate line noise,
        a baud rate or character format mismatch, or loss of synchronization during
        data reception. RXNOISEINT is not updated during a received break.
