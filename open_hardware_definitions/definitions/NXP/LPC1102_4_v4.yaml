        If this bit cleared to 0 while a character is being sent, the transmission
        of that character is completed, but no further characters are sent until this
        bit is set again. In other words, a 0 in this bit blocks the transfer of characters
        from the THR or TX FIFO into the transmit shift register. Software can clear
        this bit when it detects that the a hardware-handshaking TX-permit signal
        (CTS) has gone false, or with software handshaking, when it receives an XOFF
        character (DC3). Software can set this bit again when it detects that the
        TX-permit signal has gone true, or when it receives an XON (DC1) character.

        that the Tx FIFO is not full. If the Tx FIFO was previously empty and the
        SPI controller is not busy on the bus, transmission of the data will begin
        immediately. Otherwise the data written to this register will be sent as soon
        as all previous data has been sent (and received). If the data length is less
        than 16 bit, software must right-justify the data written to this register.
        Read: software can read data from this register whenever the RNE bit in the
        Status register is 1, indicating that the Rx FIFO is not empty. When software
        reads this register, the SPI controller returns data from the least recent
        frame in the Rx FIFO. If the data length is less than 16 bit, the data is
        right-justified in this field with higher order bits filled with 0s.'
