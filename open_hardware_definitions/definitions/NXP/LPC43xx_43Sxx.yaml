        When FIFO data count is less than or equal to this number, DMA/FIFO request

        request or interrupt is generated, regardless of threshold programming. In
        non-DMA mode, when transmit FIFO threshold (TXDR) interrupt is enabled, then
        interrupt is generated instead of DMA request. During end of packet, on last
        interrupt, host is responsible for filling FIFO with only required remaining
        bytes (not before FIFO is full or after CIU completes data transfers, because
        FIFO may not be empty). In DMA mode, at end of packet, if last transfer is
        less than burst size, DMA controller does single cycles until required bytes
        are transferred. 12 bits - 1 bit less than FIFO-count of status register,

        with unpredictable latency and/or insufficient bandwidth where the FIFO may
        underrun because the data transferred from the latency FIFO to USB occurs

        captured in the TXSCHHEALTH to less than 10 per second in a highly utilized
        bus. Choosing a value that is too high for this register is not desired as
        it can needlessly reduce USB utilization. The time unit represented in this
        register is 1.267  ms when a device is connected in High-Speed Mode for OTG
        and SPH. The time unit represented in this register is 6.333  ms when a device
        is connected in Low/Full Speed Mode for OTG and SPH.

        one to a respective bit after it has read the setup data from Queue head.
        The response to a setup packet as in the order of operations and total response
        time is crucial to limit bus time outs while the setup lockout mechanism is
        engaged.

        it can needlessly reduce USB utilization. The time unit represented in this

        When a complete frame of pixels is transmitted to the LCD display, the value
        in VFP is used to count the number of line clock periods to wait. After the
        count has elapsed, the vertical synchronization signal, LCDFP, is asserted
        in active mode, or extra line clocks are inserted as specified by the VSW
        bit field in passive mode. VFP generates 0-255 line clock cycles. Program
        to zero on passive displays for improved contrast.

      description: Vertical back porch. This is the number of inactive lines at the
        start of a frame, after the vertical synchronization period. The 8 bit VBP
        field specifies the number of line clocks inserted at the beginning of each
        frame. The VBP count starts immediately after the vertical synchronization
        signal for the previous frame has been negated for active mode, or the extra
        line clocks have been inserted as specified by the VSW bit field in passive
        mode. After this has occurred, the count value in VBP sets the number of line
        clock periods inserted before the next frame. VBP generates 0-255 extra line
        clock cycles. Program to zero on passive displays for improved contrast.

      description: 'Lower five bits of panel clock divisor. The ten-bit PCD field,
        comprising PCD_HI (bits 31:27 of this register) and PCD_LO, is used to derive
        the LCD panel clock frequency LCDDCLK from the input clock, LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/(PCD+2).
        For monochrome STN displays with a 4 or 8-bit interface, the panel clock is
        a factor of four and eight down from the actual individual pixel clock rate.
        For color STN displays, 22/3 pixels are output per LCDDCLK cycle, so the panel
        clock is 0.375 times the pixel rate. For TFT displays, the pixel clock divider
        can be bypassed by setting the BCD bit in this register. Note: data path latency
        forces some restrictions on the usable minimum values for the panel clock
        divider in STN modes: Single panel color mode, PCD = 1 (LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/3).
        Dual panel color mode, PCD = 4 (LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/6). Single panel monochrome
        4-bit interface mode, PCD = 2(LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/4). Dual panel monochrome 4-bit
        interface mode and single panel monochrome 8-bit interface mode, PCD = 6(LCDDCLK
        = LCDCLK/8). Dual panel monochrome 8-bit interface mode, PCD = 14(LCDDCLK

        mode. If the Core is configured for 1000 Mbps operation, or if the Jumbo frame
        mode is enabled in 10/100-Mbps mode, the threshold for deferral is 155,680
        bits times. Deferral begins when the transmitter is ready to transmit, but
        is prevented because of an active CRS (carrier sense) signal on the MII. Defer
        time is not cumulative. If the transmitter defers for 10,000 bit times, then
        transmits, collides, backs off, and then has to defer again after completion
        of back-off, the deferral timer resets to 0 and restarts.  When this bit is

        CRS signal goes inactive. This bit is applicable only in Half-Duplex mode

        bus. PBL can be programmed with permissible values of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and

        this PBL value is applicable for TxDMA transactions only.  The PBL values

        is limited by the size of the Tx FIFO and Rx FIFO in the MTL layer and the
        data bus width on the DMA. The FIFO has a constraint that the maximum beat
        supported is half the depth of the FIFO, except when specified (as given below).
        For different data bus widths and FIFO sizes, the valid PBL range (including
        x8 mode) is provided in the following table. If the PBL is common for both
        transmit and receive DMA, the minimum Rx FIFO and Tx FIFO depths must be considered.

      description: Start/Stop Transmission Command  When this bit is set, transmission
        is placed in the Running state, and the DMA checks the Transmit List at the
        current position for a frame to be transmitted. Descriptor acquisition is
        attempted either from the current position in the list, which is the Transmit
        List Base Address set by the DMA_TRANS_DES_ADDR register or from the position
        retained when transmission was stopped previously. If the current descriptor
        is not owned by the DMA, transmission enters the Suspended state and Transmit
        Buffer Unavailable (DMA_STAT register, bit 2) is set. The Start Transmission
        command is effective only when transmission is stopped. If the command is
        issued before setting the DMA_TRANS_DES_ADDR register, then the DMA behavior
        is unpredictable.  When this bit is reset, the transmission process is placed
        in the Stopped state after completing the transmission of the current frame.
        The Next Descriptor position in the Transmit List is saved, and becomes the
        current position when transmission is restarted. The stop transmission command
        is effective only the transmission of the current frame is complete or when

        cannot clear this type of field, and a register write of 0 to this bit has
        no effect on this field.  When this bit is set, the transmit FIFO controller
        logic is reset to its default values and thus all data in the Tx FIFO is lost/flushed.
        This bit is cleared internally when the flushing operation is completed fully.
        The Operation Mode register should not be written to until this bit is cleared.
        The data which is already accepted by the MAC transmitter will not be flushed.
        It will be scheduled for transmission and will result in underflow and runt
        frame transmission.  The flush operation completes only after emptying the
        TxFIFO of its contents and all the pending Transmit Status of the transmitted
        frames are accepted by the host. In order to complete this flush operation,
        the PHY transmit clock is required to be active.

      description: Loopback Mode Select.  The modem loopback mode provides a mechanism
        to perform diagnostic loopback testing. Serial data from the transmitter is
        connected internally to serial input of the receiver. Input pin, RXD1, has
        no effect on loopback and output pin, TXD1 is held in marking state. The 4
        modem inputs (CTS, DSR, RI and DCD) are disconnected externally. Externally,
        the modem outputs (RTS, DTR) are set inactive. Internally, the 4 modem outputs
        are connected to the 4 modem inputs. As a result of these connections, the
        upper 4 bits of the MSR will be driven by the lower 4 bits of the MCR rather
        than the 4 modem inputs in normal mode. This permits modem status interrupts
        to be generated in loopback mode by writing the lower 4 bits of MCR.
