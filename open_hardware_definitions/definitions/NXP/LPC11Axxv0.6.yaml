        If this bit cleared to 0 while a character is being sent, the transmission
        of that character is completed, but no further characters are sent until this
        bit is set again. In other words, a 0 in this bit blocks the transfer of characters
        from the THR or TX FIFO into the transmit shift register. Software can clear
        this bit when it detects that the a hardware-handshaking TX-permit signal
        (CTS) has gone false, or with software handshaking, when it receives an XOFF
        character (DC3). Software can set this bit again when it detects that the
        TX-permit signal has gone true, or when it receives an XON (DC1) character.
