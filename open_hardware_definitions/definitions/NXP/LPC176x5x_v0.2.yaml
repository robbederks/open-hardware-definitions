      description: Loopback Mode Select.  The modem loopback mode provides a mechanism
        to perform diagnostic loopback testing. Serial data from the transmitter is
        connected internally to serial input of the receiver. Input pin, RXD1, has
        no effect on loopback and output pin, TXD1 is held in marking state. The 4
        modem inputs (CTS, DSR, RI and DCD) are disconnected externally. Externally,
        the modem outputs (RTS, DTR) are set inactive. Internally, the 4 modem outputs
        are connected to the 4 modem inputs. As a result of these connections, the
        upper 4 bits of the MSR will be driven by the lower 4 bits of the MCR rather
        than the 4 modem inputs in normal mode. This permits modem status interrupts
        to be generated in loopback mode by writing the lower 4 bits of MCR.

      description: BACK-TO-BACK INTER-PACKET-GAP.This is a programmable field representing
        the nibble time offset of the minimum possible period between the end of any
        transmitted packet to the beginning of the next. In Full-Duplex mode, the
        register value should be the desired period in nibble times minus 3. In Half-Duplex
        mode, the register value should be the desired period in nibble times minus
        6. In Full-Duplex the recommended setting is 0x15 (21d), which represents
        the minimum IPG of 960 ns (in 100 Mbps mode) or 9.6 us (in 10 Mbps mode).
        In Half-Duplex the recommended setting is 0x12 (18d), which also represents
        the minimum IPG of 960 ns (in 100 Mbps mode) or 9.6 us (in 10 Mbps mode).

        MAC continues timing IPGR2 and transmits, knowingly causing a collision, thus
        ensuring fair access to medium. Its range of values is 0x0 to IPGR2. The recommended
