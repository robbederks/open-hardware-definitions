        for each DMA trigger. This can be used, for example, with peripherals that
        contain a FIFO that can initiate a DMA operation when the FIFO reaches a certain
        level. 0000: Burst size = 1 (20). 0001: Burst size = 2 (21). 0010: Burst size

        is cleared. If you want to remove the halt condition and keep the SCT in the

        with one single write to this register. Once set, this bit can only be cleared

        it is allowed to include the same channels in both conversion sequences, doing
        so may cause erratic behavior of the DONE and OVERRUN bits in the data registers
        associated with any of the channels that are shared between the two sequences.
        Any erratic OVERRUN behavior will also affect overrun interrupt generation,

      description: This field contains the 12-bit A/D conversion result from the most
        recent conversion performed under conversion sequence associated with this
        register.   This will be a binary fraction representing the voltage on the
        currently-selected input channel as it falls within the range of VREFP to
        VREFN. Zero in the field indicates that the voltage on the input pin was less
        than, equal to, or close to that on VREFN, while 0xFFF indicates that the
        voltage on the input was close to, equal to, or greater than that on V REFP.  DATAVALID
        = 1 indicates that this result has not yet been read.
